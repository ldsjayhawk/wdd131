          <h2>Site Plan</h2>
            <h3>Site Name: Franchise GM Tools</h3>
              <p>The site name was chosen because this is going to be a site that contains tools to support a current year-round fantasy baseball site that I am currently in.
            The league is called FGM or Franchise GM.  The intention is to further develop this site to refine these tools for actual use.</p>
            <h3>Site Purpose:</h3>
              <p>The purpose of the site is to provide tools that will augment those already provided by the site we play at. 
              <p>• The sign-up provides the opportunity to sign up and provide needed info to the commissioner.
              <p>• The draft page provides the opportunity to automate draft functions with the scope of players narrowed to only those who can be selected.</p>
              <p>• The roster page displays information about the players on a team's roster.</p>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
              <p>• Where can I sign-up?</p>
              <p>• Where can I particpate in the draft?</p>
              <p>• Where can I see my roster?</p>
            <h3>Color Schema</h3>
              <p>• Green (#5a8b39) will be used for the main header and buttons.  It is a green color close to the color of the grass found at a baseball field.</p>
              <p>• White will be used for the background</p>
              <p>• Black will be used for smaller headers and paragraph fonts</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
              <h4>•Main heading font: Arial</h4>
              <p>•Subsequent headings and paragraph font: Figtree</p>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
