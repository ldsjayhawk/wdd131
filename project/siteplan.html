      <h1><span id="draftyear"></span>Franchise GM Tools</h1>
      <p>The site name was chosen because this is going to be a site that contains tools to support a current year-round fantasy baseball site that I am currently in.
      The league is called FGM or Franchise GM.  The intention is to further develop this site to refine these tools for actual use.</p>

            <h2>Site Plan</h2>
            <h3>Site Name: Franchise GM Tools</h3>
            <h3>Site Purpose:</h3>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>heading-font: Markazi Text</h4>
            <p>paragraph-font: Figtree</p>
            Site Name: The site or domain name is the primary identifier and is critical for branding, visibility, and recognition, often coupled with a logo or logo version. A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally important but not required in this class. Provide a valid site name that is relevant to your project and a short reason why the the site name was selected.
 The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing what services and information will be provided.
Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
• The site provides a hub for regional e-biking by listing providing trail and e-bike recommendation information along with a membership information form.
Scenarios: Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience of the organization or company. The questions will help you drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target audience of the site. Include at least two scenarios.
Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
• What is the best e-bike to get for mountainous areas?
• Where can I find contact information for the club's directors?
Color Schema: The color schema refers to the carefully selected site colors. Define at least two colors and show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, accents, and so on.
! Use your selected color schema on this document.

Typography: The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections need to be selected. Indicate where each selected font will be used (such as headings, body, and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections as needed.
